        <h2><strong> What is Journaling?</strong></h2> 
        <p>Journaling is basically writing down your thoughts, feelings, and everyday moments in a notebook or on your phone. 
              It doesn't need to be perfect or fancy â€” it's just a space for you to be real and honest with yourself. 
              You can write about your day, your dreams, your goals, things you're grateful for, or anything on your mind. 
              It's your own little corner where you can think freely, express yourself, and just let your thoughts flow. 
              When you do it a little every day, it becomes a simple habit that feels relaxing, inspiring, and helps you 
              stay connected with yourself.</p> <!--Introduction to journaling-->
