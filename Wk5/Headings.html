    <h1> My name is Irusha. My favorite color is green.</h1>
    <h2> My favorite thing to do in Kansas city is visiting museums or art galleries. I like it because it amazes me.</h2>
    <h3> I love to read books or watch movies when I have a free day.</h3>
    <h4> If I could go anywhere, I would go to my parents' house and spend some time with them tasting my mom's cooking.</h4>
    <h5> My goal in learning HTML is to build awesome web pages of my own without flaws.</h5>
